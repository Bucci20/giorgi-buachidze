        <div class="gio2"><p>my 3 days in Vienna turned out to be incredible. Partly because the Austrian capital has long been on my bucket list.
            On paper, Vienna seemed to tick all the boxes for my liking: an incredible cultural scene, elegant coffee houses, great classical music concerts. I were a little worried that i might visit the city with too much expectation, but as it turned out, Vienna is magical, and it deserves to be one of the most liveable cities in the world.
            In fact, i came to the conclusion that 3 days in Vienna were not enough for me, and i am seriously considering moving there next.
            For our 3 days in Vienna itinerary, i prepared a comprehensive guide filled with history, music, art and food. Essentially, i wanted to share with you how to have the best time of your life visiting one of the coolest cities in the world. Ready? Let’s go!</p> </div>
